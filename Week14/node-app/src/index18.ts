/*
ðŸ‘‰ Since it satisfies both GoodUSer and BadUser, it's still valid for the union GoodUSer | BadUser.
A union means "at least one of these types", and if an object satisfies both, that's still fine.

In TypeScript, a union doesnâ€™t restrict you to only one of the types â€” it just says the object must 
be assignable to at least one. And if it's assignable to both, even better.
