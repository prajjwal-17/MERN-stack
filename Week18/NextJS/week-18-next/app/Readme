# Next.js Layout — Quick Recall

## What is a layout?
- A **layout** is a **persistent UI wrapper** for routes
- It wraps pages and renders them via `children`
- Layouts **stay mounted** while navigating between pages

```tsx
export default function Layout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}

Why layouts exist

Avoid repeating UI (navbar, sidebar, footer)

Preserve state across route changes

Improve performance (no remounts)

Layout vs Page

Layout → structure (persistent)

Page → content (changes per route)

Nested layouts

Each folder can have its own layout.tsx

Inner layouts wrap only their route segment

Root layout
 └── Dashboard layout
     └── Page

Rules to remember

Root layout must return <html> and <body>

Layouts are Server Components by default

Use layouts only for shared, stable UI

One-line memory hook

Layouts define structure; pages define content.
