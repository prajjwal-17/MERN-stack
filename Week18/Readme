this setup is done in prisma v6 and node v22

Use this if you want the README to actually teach.

## Backend Setup Guide (Prisma v6 + Node v22)

This backend intentionally uses Prisma v6 instead of v7 to avoid
config-based complexity and breaking changes.

---

### Step 1: Verify Node Version
```bash
node -v
# v22.x.x

Step 2: Install Dependencies
npm install

Step 3: Install Prisma v6 (Pinned)
npm install -D prisma@6.7.0
npm install @prisma/client@6.7.0

Step 4: Environment Variables

Create .env in the project root:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/dbname

Step 5: Prisma Schema Configuration

prisma/schema.prisma:

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}


In Prisma v6, the database URL must be defined here.

Step 6: Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate


Expected output:

✔ Generated Prisma Client (v6.7.0)


Ignore any update messages suggesting Prisma v7.

Step 7: Use Prisma Client in Code
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
  await prisma.$connect();
  console.log("Connected to database");
}

main()
  .catch(console.error)
  .finally(() => prisma.$disconnect());


Do not import Prisma from a relative path like ../generated.

Step 8: Run the Project
npm run dev


This runs:

tsc -b && node ./dist/index.js

Notes

Project uses ESM ("type": "module")

moduleResolution is nodenext

No prisma.config.ts is used

Prisma v6 avoids Accelerate and adapter requirements

## Final Blunt Advice (README-worthy)

You might even add this at the end:

```md
⚠️ This setup is intentionally conservative.
Prisma v7 is more complex and not required for this project.
If you upgrade, expect breaking changes.

# 2️⃣ “WHY NOT PRISMA v7?” SECTION (Very Important)

This prevents future-you (or teammates) from “upgrading” and breaking everything again.

```md
## Why Prisma v6 Instead of v7?

Prisma v7 introduces:
- `prisma.config.ts`
- Config-based datasource handling
- Required PrismaClient constructor options
- Tight coupling with Accelerate and adapters
- Stricter TypeScript behavior

For this project, Prisma v7 caused:
- Constructor type errors
- ESM/TypeScript friction
- Confusion around datasource configuration
- Tooling instability on Windows + Node 22

Prisma v6 was chosen because:
- `new PrismaClient()` works without options
- Datasource configuration lives in `schema.prisma`
- No config-based generation required
- Stable and predictable for learning and development

**Do not upgrade Prisma unless you intentionally migrate the setup.**
